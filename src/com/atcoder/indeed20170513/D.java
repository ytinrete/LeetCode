 Problem Statement
 There is a road with a length of L meters that runs east-west, and there are N houses built along this road.
 The i-th house from the west is located xi meters east of the west end of the road, and there are ri people who live in the house.

 A station is going to be built on this road, and there was a discussion on the location of the station.
 Let the location of the station be P meters east of the west end of the road. According to the law, P must be a integer satisfying 0≤P≤L.
 After the discussion, it was decided that the location of the station will be chosen so that it minimizes the disutility calculated as follows:

 (disutility) = (the sum of (|xi−P|×ri) over all i (1≤i≤N))
 Here, |a| denotes the absolute value of a.

 Find the disutility when the location of the station is chosen to minimize it.

 Constraints
 All input values are integers.
 1≤L≤1010
 1≤N≤105
 0≤x1<x2<…<xN≤L
 1≤ri≤103

 110
 When P=40, the disutility is |20−40|×3+|50−40|×2+|70−40|×1=110. There is no location with a lower disutility.
